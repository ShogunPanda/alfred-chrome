# Alfred Chrome Workflow

This workflow allows you to open a URL in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) via [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/).

The recognized syntax is:

`chrome [as USER] [in incognito] URL`

The text under square bracket is optional, the text in uppercase must be replaced with appropriate values.

## Installation

Apart from normal workflow installation, the only requirement is the [oj](https://github.com/ohler55/oj) gem, which can be installed by opening the terminal and running:

`gem install oj`
