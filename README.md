If you hold the `Alt` key while selecting the result item, the window will be open using incognito mode.

If you use Canary version of Chrome or similar applications, like Chromium, you can instruct the workflow to use it.

To do it:

* Open the `Configure workflow and variables` by clicking on the second icon on right section of the workflow header.
* Under the `Workflow Environment Variables` section, create a variable called `ALFRED_CHROME_NAME` and enter the same name you see in your Applications folder.
* Click on `Save` and you're good to go! :)
